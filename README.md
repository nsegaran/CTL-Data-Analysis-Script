File: CTL Data Processing Code

Name: Nicole Segaran

This program takes in any subset of modified* CTL event registration data  saved to My Drive > NS CTL Data Visualization > Raw Data of user's Google Drive and can tally the count frequency of the role, majors, years, or schools of unique attendees depending on user specification of parameters. CSV of tally is exported to My Drive > NS CTL Data Visualization > New Processed Data. Folders must be set up as such before running code.

2020 - 2021 Modifications - 
*Stanford School column added to CHEM (Fall+Winter) and Math VSH (Fall) files; Degree Program: column combined and deleted extra in VSH (Fall + Winter) files; Stanford School column populated for Undergraduate Students in VSH (Fall + Winter + Spring) and Workshops (Winter + Spring) since there was no data; many files from each category had columns added or taken away to make sure they aligned with the other sheets in their category; unmodified data from CTL event registration over 2020 stored at https://github.com/a7c/ctl-data-visualization.git

2021 - 2022 Modifications - 
Stanford School column populated for Undergraduate Students in VSH (Fall + Winter + Spring) and In-Person Study Halls (Spring)
Degree Program columns combined for all grad-inclusive events
Winter VSH and Workshops had to unmerge some cells
Spring Workshops some didn't have Undergrad Major column

NOTES FOR OTHERS:
Majors for Grad students denoted by "Degree Program:" column

Role at Stanford was denoted by "Role at Stanford " or "Which degree(s) are you pursuing?" on data sheets...I used Which degree(s) are you pursuing?" when available because had more granular data...but there were many sheets where neither was populated

I had to modify many Undergraduate and Graduate mixed events to combine the "Degree Programs:" column from one column to five columns
